This package is responsible to encrypt and decrypt the user data, prepare it to print out and store it. Every user get his Data except the ID encrypted with his uniqe secret key which will be built by putting the password hash, %&% and the username together.
This should save the other users data to get pwned by programm usage. Then all the users file data will be encrypted by the same key, this fixed key is 64 byte long and is a mix of alphanumerical and special characters.
